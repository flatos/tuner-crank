# A Crank-Style Knob for an Antenna Tuner's Rotary Inductor

![Graph](img/Assembly.png)


I have an MFJ-989C antenna tuner...the user experience would be improved if it had a "crank"-style knob for rotary inductor control, like many newer tuners.
This repository contain STL models and SolidWorks files for a crank suitable for any control with a 1/4" shaft.


## Assembly

Print the STL files in the '/models' directory. I used `eSun ePA-CF` filament (carbon-fiber nylon) for the crank and ASA for the knob,
but presumably anything would work.

Use the parts from a couple of pop rivets to assemble the pin for the knob as shown.

Clean up the holes in the parts with a drill (0.25" for the shaft and interior of knob, 0.191" or so for the inserts, 0.080" for the pin).

Assemble and epoxy the pin in place on the underside. Use a bit of paper or similar to space the knob away from the crank until the glue cures to ensure that it spins freely.
